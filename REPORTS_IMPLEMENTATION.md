5. **src/components/reports/UserActivityChart.tsx** - User activity visualization
6. **src/components/reports/ProcessTable.tsx** - Sortable/searchable process table
7. **src/components/reports/StatsCards.tsx** - Statistics summary cards
8. **src/components/reports/index.ts** - Component exports

### Documentation
9. **docs/REPORTS_FEATURE.md** - Feature documentation
10. **REPORTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - This file

## Files Modified

1. **src/App.tsx** - Added Reports route and import
2. **src/pages/Index.tsx** - Added Reports tab to main navigation

## Key Features

### For All Users
- ✅ View personal process statistics
- ✅ Interactive status distribution chart
- ✅ Process timeline visualization
- ✅ Detailed process table with search and sort
- ✅ Date range filtering (7d, 30d, 90d, all time)
- ✅ Export options (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- ✅ Real-time data refresh

### For Admin Users (Additional)
- ✅ View all users' data system-wide
- ✅ Filter by specific user
- ✅ User activity analysis tab
- ✅ User email column in process table
- ✅ Aggregate statistics across all users

## Role-Based Access Control

### Admin View
```typescript
// Admin can see all processes
const response = await adminService.getProcesses({
  userId: selectedUserId === 'all' ? undefined : selectedUserId,
  dateFrom: getDateFromRange(dateRange),
});
```

### User View
```typescript
// Regular users see only their own processes
const allProcesses = await processService.getProcesses();
```

## Data Visualizations

1. **Stats Cards** - 4 key metrics at a glance
2. **Status Distribution** - Pie chart showing process breakdown
3. **Timeline Chart** - Bar chart of created vs completed processes
4. **User Activity** - Horizontal bars showing user engagement (admin only)
5. **Process Table** - Detailed list with search and sort

## Process Status Types

The system tracks these process statuses:
- `CREATED` - Initial state
- `UPLOADING` - File upload in progress
- `PROCESSING` - Data processing
- `SEARCHING` - Database search active
- `VALIDATING` - Validation in progress
- `COMPLETED` - Successfully finished
- `ERROR` - Failed with error

## Usage

### Access the Reports
1. Navigate to the main dashboard
2. Click on the "Reports" tab
3. View your analytics dashboard

### Filter Data
- Select date range from dropdown
- (Admin only) Select user from dropdown
- Use search box in table for specific processes

### Export Data
- Click Export dropdown
- Choose format (CSV, Excel, or PDF)
- Download will begin automatically

## Technical Stack

- **React** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **React Query** - Data fetching and caching
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **shadcn/ui** - UI components
- **Lucide React** - Icons

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/processes` - User's own processes
- `GET /api/admin/processes` - All processes (admin)
- `GET /api/admin/users` - User list (admin)

### Data Processing
All data aggregation and calculations happen client-side in the `useReports` hook for optimal performance and flexibility.

## Next Steps

To test the feature:
1. Start the development server
2. Login as a regular user to see personal view
3. Login as an admin to see system-wide view
4. Try different date ranges and filters
5. Test search and sort in the process table

## Important Notes

### Current Implementation Status

✅ **Working Features:**
- Reports page loads successfully
- Stats cards display process metrics
- Status distribution chart
- Timeline visualization
- Process table with search/sort
- Date range filtering
- User interface for both admin and regular users

⚠️ **Temporary Limitations:**
- **Admin cross-user viewing**: Currently, all users (including admins) see only their own processes
- **Reason**: Backend `/api/admin/processes` endpoint doesn't exist yet
- **Workaround**: Frontend uses regular `/api/processes` endpoint for all users
- **User filtering**: Admin user filter dropdown is visible but filters already-loaded data only

### Backend Endpoint Needed

To enable full admin functionality, add this backend endpoint:

```typescript
// backend/src/routes/admin.ts
router.get('/processes', 
  requirePermission('processes.read'),
  logActivity('ADMIN_VIEW_PROCESSES'),
  adminController.getAllProcesses
);
```

Once the backend endpoint is added, uncomment the admin service calls in `src/hooks/useReports.ts`.

### Other Notes

- Export functionality is stubbed and shows toast notifications
- Real export implementation can be added by connecting to backend export endpoints
- All charts are responsive and work on mobile devices
- Data is cached for 2 minutes to reduce API calls
- Console logging added for debugging (can be removed in production)
