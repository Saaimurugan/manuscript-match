# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application is experiencing critical syntax errors in the ErrorBoundary component that are preventing the application from loading and functioning properly. Multiple test runs show the same syntax error occurring at line 209 of the ErrorBoundary.tsx file, which is breaking the entire application. Additionally, the error reporting system needs enhancement to provide better error tracking and user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without syntax errors, so that I can access and use all features of the manuscript matching system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the ErrorBoundary component SHALL compile without syntax errors
2. WHEN the application loads THEN all components SHALL render properly without compilation failures
3. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the page SHALL load without Vite/React compilation errors
4. WHEN the development server runs THEN there SHALL be no blocking syntax errors in the console

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user experiencing an error, I want to report bugs easily through the application interface, so that the development team can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the ErrorBoundary SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a user clicks "Report Bug" THEN the system SHALL collect comprehensive error information
3. WHEN error information is collected THEN it SHALL include error ID, stack trace, component stack, timestamp, and user context
4. WHEN a bug report is generated THEN it SHALL be formatted in a way that's useful for developers
5. WHEN the bug report is created THEN the user SHALL receive confirmation that the report was submitted

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging and tracking, so that I can quickly identify, diagnose, and fix issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN in development mode THEN error details SHALL be visible to developers
3. WHEN in production mode THEN errors SHALL be logged to an error tracking service
4. WHEN an error is caught THEN it SHALL include component stack trace and user context
5. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN each SHALL have a unique error ID for tracking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to gracefully handle errors and provide recovery options, so that I can continue using the system even when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the user SHALL see recovery options (retry, go home)
2. WHEN a user clicks "Try Again" THEN the component SHALL attempt to recover from the error
3. WHEN a user clicks "Go Home" THEN they SHALL be redirected to the main dashboard
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the rest of the application SHALL continue to function normally
5. WHEN an error is resolved THEN the user SHALL be able to continue their workflow

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want error boundaries to work correctly during automated testing, so that test failures can be properly diagnosed and reported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated tests run THEN syntax errors SHALL not prevent test execution
2. WHEN an error occurs during testing THEN it SHALL be captured in test reports
3. WHEN tests fail due to errors THEN the error context SHALL be preserved for debugging
4. WHEN error boundaries are triggered during tests THEN they SHALL provide meaningful error information
5. WHEN tests encounter errors THEN the error details SHALL be included in the test output
