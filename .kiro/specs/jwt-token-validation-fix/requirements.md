# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical JWT token validation and error handling issues in the authentication system. The current implementation fails when attempting to decode malformed or invalid JWT tokens, causing repeated authentication errors and poor user experience. This feature will implement robust token validation, proper error handling, and graceful fallback mechanisms to ensure stable authentication behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle invalid JWT tokens gracefully without causing repeated errors, so that I can continue using the application without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters an invalid JWT token THEN it SHALL validate the token format before attempting to decode it
2. WHEN a JWT token fails validation THEN the system SHALL clear the invalid token and redirect to login
3. WHEN token decoding fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and initiate logout process
4. WHEN multiple token validation failures occur THEN the system SHALL prevent infinite retry loops

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive JWT token validation utilities, so that token-related errors are caught early and handled consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating a JWT token THEN the system SHALL check for proper format (three parts separated by dots)
2. WHEN validating token payload THEN the system SHALL verify base64 encoding before decoding
3. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific error types for different failure modes
4. WHEN token is expired THEN the system SHALL distinguish between expired and malformed tokens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic token refresh to work reliably without causing authentication loops, so that my session remains active during normal usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking token expiration THEN the system SHALL validate token format first
2. WHEN token refresh is triggered THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous refresh attempts
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL clear authentication state and require re-login
4. WHEN token is near expiration THEN the system SHALL attempt refresh only once per expiration window

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging of authentication errors, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot authentication issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific failure reason
2. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL include relevant context in error logs
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure with error details
4. WHEN logout is triggered by token errors THEN the system SHALL log the triggering event
