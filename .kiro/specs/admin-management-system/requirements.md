# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive admin management system that provides administrative capabilities for managing users, processes, and system permissions. The system supports four distinct actor types (User, Admin, QC, Manager) with role-based access control and granular permission management. The admin interface allows for complete user lifecycle management, process control, and activity monitoring.

## Requirements

1. WHEN an Admin user logs in THEN the system SHALL display an admin navigation option
2. WHEN an Admin accesses the admin page THEN the system SHALL display all available administrative functions
3. IF a non-Admin user attempts to access the admin page THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect to appropriate page
4. WHEN the admin page loads THEN the system SHALL display user management, process management, and activity log sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to promote existing users to admin status, so that I can delegate administrative responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin selects a user THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Make User Admin"

2. WHEN assigning rights THEN the system SHALL display available permissions with current assignments
3. WHEN custom rights are assigned to a user THEN the system SHALL override default actor permissions
