# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The automated test reporting feature enhances the ScholarFinder backend build process by automatically generating comprehensive test reports in multiple formats whenever tests are executed. This ensures that test results are consistently documented, easily accessible, and provide detailed insights into system health, performance metrics, and test coverage for both development and CI/CD environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Report Generation During Build

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test reports to be automatically generated whenever I run the build process so that I have immediate access to comprehensive test results without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically generate test reports after running all tests
2. WHEN tests complete successfully THEN the system SHALL create both HTML and markdown versions of the test report
3. WHEN test execution fails THEN the system SHALL still generate a report showing the failure details and partial results
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include timestamps and build metadata
5. IF report generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but not fail the entire build process

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Test Report Content

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed test reports that include all relevant metrics and results so that I can quickly assess system health and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include overall test statistics (total, passed, failed, skipped)
2. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL provide test results broken down by category (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
3. WHEN reports are created THEN the system SHALL include code coverage metrics with percentages
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL show performance benchmarks and response times
5. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL list API endpoint coverage statistics
6. IF test failures occur THEN the system SHALL include detailed failure information and stack traces

### Requirement 3: Multiple Report Formats

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test reports available in multiple formats so that I can choose the most appropriate format for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL create an interactive HTML report with collapsible sections
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create a markdown report for easy integration with documentation
3. WHEN HTML reports are created THEN the system SHALL include interactive features like filtering and sorting
4. WHEN markdown reports are generated THEN the system SHALL use proper formatting for readability
5. IF additional formats are needed THEN the system SHALL support extensible report generation

### Requirement 4: Build Script Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test reporting to be seamlessly integrated into existing build scripts so that it works with current development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the npm build script runs THEN the system SHALL execute tests and generate reports automatically
2. WHEN CI/CD pipelines run THEN the system SHALL generate reports suitable for automated environments
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL place them in a consistent, predictable location
4. WHEN build scripts execute THEN the system SHALL provide clear console output about report generation
5. IF report generation takes significant time THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators

### Requirement 5: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test report generation to be efficient and not significantly impact build times so that development velocity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL complete report creation within 30 seconds
2. WHEN processing test results THEN the system SHALL use memory-efficient data processing
3. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL avoid blocking other build processes
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files and resources
5. IF large test suites are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them without memory issues

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure test report generation options so that I can customize reports for different environments and needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring reports THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling specific report formats
2. WHEN setting up reporting THEN the system SHALL support custom output directories
3. WHEN configuring reports THEN the system SHALL allow customization of report titles and metadata
4. WHEN setting report options THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations
5. IF custom templates are needed THEN the system SHALL support template customization

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling in test report generation so that build failures don't prevent me from getting available test information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test execution fails THEN the system SHALL generate partial reports with available data
2. WHEN report generation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN file system issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide fallbacks
4. WHEN external dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL continue with basic report generation
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on resolution steps

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test reporting to work seamlessly with the existing Jest test framework and coverage tools so that no changes are needed to current test setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Jest test results THEN the system SHALL parse and integrate all test output formats
2. WHEN processing coverage data THEN the system SHALL work with existing Jest coverage configuration
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing test functionality
4. WHEN integrating with tests THEN the system SHALL support all current test categories (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
5. IF test configuration changes THEN the system SHALL adapt automatically without manual updates
