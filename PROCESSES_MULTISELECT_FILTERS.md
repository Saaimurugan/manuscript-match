# Processes Page - Multiselect Filters

## Overview

Converted the Status and Stage filters from single-select dropdowns to multiselect checkboxes, allowing users to filter by multiple statuses and stages simultaneously.

## What Changed

### Before (Single Select)
- Could only filter by ONE status at a time
- Could only filter by ONE stage at a time
- Example: Show "COMPLETED" OR "PROCESSING" (not both)

### After (Multiselect)
- Can filter by MULTIPLE statuses at once
- Can filter by MULTIPLE stages at once
- Example: Show "COMPLETED" AND "PROCESSING" together

## New Filter UI

### Status Filter Button
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ 🔍 Status    [2]│  ← Badge shows count of selected
└─────────────────┘
```

### Status Filter Popover

## Use Cases

### Example 1: View Active Processes
**Goal**: See all processes currently being worked on

**Steps**:
1. Click "Status" button
2. Check: Processing, Searching, Validating
3. Click outside to close
4. See all active processes

**Result**: Shows processes in any of the 3 active states

### Example 2: Early Stage Processes
**Goal**: See processes in initial stages

**Steps**:
1. Click "Stage" button
2. Check: Upload & Extract, Metadata Extraction
3. Click outside to close

**Result**: Shows processes in either of the 2 early stages

### Example 3: Completed or Error
**Goal**: See finished processes (success or failure)

**Steps**:
1. Click "Status" button
2. Check: Completed, Error
3. Click outside to close

**Result**: Shows all finished processes regardless of outcome

### Example 4: Complex Filter
**Goal**: Active processes in specific stages

**Steps**:
1. Status: Check Processing, Searching
2. Stage: Check Database Search, Manual Search, Validation
3. Result: Processes that are (Processing OR Searching) AND in (Database Search OR Manual Search OR Validation)

### Example 5: Quality Control View
**Goal**: See processes in validation or completed

**Steps**:
1. Status: Check Completed
2. Stage: Check Validation, Recommendations
3. Result: Completed processes OR processes in validation/recommendations stages

## Filter Logic

### AND Between Filter Types
Different filter types use AND logic:
- Status filters AND Stage filters AND Search

### OR Within Filter Type
Same filter type uses OR logic:
- Status: COMPLETED OR PROCESSING OR ERROR
- Stage: UPLOAD OR VALIDATION OR EXPORT

### Example Logic
```
Search: "research"
Status: [COMPLETED, PROCESSING]
Stage: [VALIDATION, EXPORT]

Result = processes WHERE
  (title/description contains "research") AND
  (status = COMPLETED OR status = PROCESSING) AND
  (stage = VALIDATION OR stage = EXPORT)
```

## Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [statusFilters, setStatusFilters] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [stageFilters, setStageFilters] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

### Toggle Function
```typescript
const toggleStatusFilter = (status: string) => {
  setStatusFilters(prev => 
    prev.includes(status) 
      ? prev.filter(s => s !== status)  // Remove if exists
      : [...prev, status]                // Add if doesn't exist
  );
};
```

### Filter Application
```typescript
// Apply status filters (multiselect)
if (statusFilters.length > 0) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(process => 
    statusFilters.includes(process.status)
  );
}

// Apply stage filters (multiselect)
if (stageFilters.length > 0) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(process => 
    stageFilters.includes(process.currentStep)
  );
}
```

### Active Filter Display
```typescript
{statusFilters.map((status) => (
  <Badge key={status} variant="secondary" className="gap-1 text-xs">
    {status}
    <X onClick={() => toggleStatusFilter(status)} />
  </Badge>
))}
```

## UI Components Used
