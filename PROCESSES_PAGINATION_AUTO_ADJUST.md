# Pagination Auto-Adjust on Delete

## Overview

Added automatic pagination adjustment when the last item on a page is deleted, preventing users from seeing an empty page.

## Problem Scenario

### Before Fix
1. User is on page 5 with 1 process
2. User deletes that process
3. Page 5 is now empty
4. User sees empty page with no processes
5. User must manually click "Previous" to see processes

### After Fix
1. User is on page 5 with 1 process
2. User deletes that process
3. **Automatically navigates to page 4**
4. User immediately sees processes
5. Smooth, seamless experience

## Implementation

### Detection Logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (filteredAndSortedProcesses.length > 0 && 
      paginatedProcesses.length === 0 && 
      currentPage > 1) {
    // Current page is empty but there are processes, go to previous page
    setCurrentPage(currentPage - 1);
  }
}, [filteredAndSortedProcesses.length, paginatedProcesses.length, currentPage]);
```

### Conditions Checked
1. **There are processes** (`filteredAndSortedProcesses.length > 0`)
   - Ensures we're not on an empty list
   
2. **Current page is empty** (`paginatedProcesses.length === 0`)
   - The current page has no items to display
   
3. **Not on first page** (`currentPage > 1`)
   - Only adjust if we can go back a page
   - Don't adjust if already on page 1

## Use Cases

### Case 1: Delete Last Item on Last Page
**Scenario:**
- Total: 19 processes
- Page size: 9
- Current page: 3 (showing process 19)
- User deletes process 19

**Result:**
- Total: 18 processes
- Automatically goes to page 2
- Shows processes 10-18

### Case 2: Delete Last Item on Middle Page
**Scenario:**
- Total: 27 processes
- Page size: 9
- Current page: 2 (showing process 10-18)
- User deletes processes 10-18 one by one

**Result:**
- After deleting process 10 (last on page 2)
- Automatically goes to page 1
- Shows processes 1-9

### Case 3: Delete Last Item on First Page
**Scenario:**
- Total: 1 process
- Page size: 9
- Current page: 1 (showing process 1)
- User deletes process 1

**Result:**
- Total: 0 processes
- Stays on page 1
- Shows "No processes yet" empty state

### Case 4: Delete Item But Page Still Has Items
**Scenario:**
- Total: 20 processes
- Page size: 9
- Current page: 2 (showing processes 10-18)
- User deletes process 15

**Result:**
- Total: 19 processes
- Stays on page 2
- Shows processes 10-18 (now 8 items)

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Empty List
- **Condition**: No processes at all
- **Behavior**: Stays on page 1, shows empty state
- **Reason**: No pages to navigate to

### 2. First Page
- **Condition**: On page 1 and it becomes empty
- **Behavior**: Stays on page 1, shows empty state
- **Reason**: Can't go to page 0

### 3. Multiple Deletes
- **Condition**: User deletes multiple items quickly
- **Behavior**: Adjusts page after each delete if needed
- **Reason**: useEffect runs on each change

### 4. Filter Then Delete
- **Condition**: Filter reduces results, then delete last item
- **Behavior**: Adjusts page, maintains filter
- **Reason**: Works with filtered results

## User Experience

### Smooth Transition
- **No manual navigation needed**
- **Immediate feedback**
- **No confusion about empty pages**
- **Maintains workflow**

### Visual Flow
```
Before Delete:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Page 3 of 3                 │
│ [Process 19]                │
│ [Delete] ← User clicks      │
└─────────────────────────────┘

After Delete (Automatic):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Page 2 of 2                 │
│ [Process 10]                │
│ [Process 11]                │
│ [Process 12]                │
│ ...                         │
│ [Process 18]                │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Integration with Other Features

### Works With Filters
- Delete last filtered item on page
- Auto-adjusts within filtered results
- Maintains active filters

### Works With Sort
- Delete last item on sorted page
- Auto-adjusts within sorted results
- Maintains sort order

### Works With Search
- Delete last searched item on page
- Auto-adjusts within search results
- Maintains search term

## Performance

- **Minimal overhead**: Simple condition check
- **Efficient**: Only runs when dependencies change
- **No flicker**: React batches the state update
- **Smooth**: Transition is instant

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Last Item on Last Page
1. Navigate to last page
2. Verify it has only 1 item
3. Delete that item
4. Verify auto-navigation to previous page
5. Verify processes are visible

### Test 2: Last Item on Middle Page
1. Navigate to middle page (e.g., page 2 of 5)
2. Delete all items on that page
3. Verify auto-navigation to previous page
4. Verify processes are visible

### Test 3: Last Item on First Page
1. Filter to show only 1 process
2. Delete that process
3. Verify stays on page 1
4. Verify empty state is shown

### Test 4: Multiple Quick Deletes
1. Navigate to page with few items
2. Quickly delete multiple items
3. Verify pagination adjusts correctly
4. Verify no errors or flicker

### Test 5: With Filters Active
1. Apply filters to reduce results
2. Navigate to last page of filtered results
3. Delete last item
4. Verify auto-navigation works
5. Verify filters remain active

## Code Flow

```
User deletes process
    ↓
React Query updates cache
    ↓
processes state updates
    ↓
filteredAndSortedProcesses recalculates
    ↓
paginatedProcesses recalculates
    ↓
useEffect detects empty page
    ↓
setCurrentPage(currentPage - 1)
    ↓
paginatedProcesses recalculates with new page
    ↓
UI shows previous page
```
